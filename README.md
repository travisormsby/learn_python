# Learn Python

This series of Jupyter Notebooks is designed to help people learn about how to use Python.  The intended audience is ArcGIS users who want to automate their workflows. The easiest way to run these notebooks is to [add them to an ArcGIS Pro project](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/pro-notebooks.htm).

If you're not familiar with using Git or GitHub, the easiest way to get these files is to click the Code button above, and choose Download ZIP.

The file names indicate the suggested order for working through these notebooks.
